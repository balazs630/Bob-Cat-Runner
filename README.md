<h1>Bob-Cat-Runner</h1>

Simple game with 'Bob' the cat using SpriteKit.

Story: When Bob wakes up from a deep afternoon sleep in the garden, it's starting to rain heavily, dark clouds rolling in over town.
The goal is to get back to the house before our scared cat washed away by the rain.

This means that the game is under development and is improved on a regular basis – through commits that add features and content, optimizations and bug fixes.
